It's amazing how many times I think an issue I have is a novel problem. Do not make this mistake! Remember, one of the most important themes in software is <b>*REUSE*</b>. Let's take advantage of our tools.

1. [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com) - You may think it's for kids, think again! There are a plethora of brilliant peeps on here doling out AI gems for free. I almost always start here to see if someone can give me a demo of exactly what I'm trying to do.

2. [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co) - This is a treasure trove of AI resources that the Open Source community has graciously provided. I start with the models section. This section even has a table of contents categorizing model functions. This index of functions enlightens me on what the current models are capable of.

3. [GitHub](https://www.github.com) - Yes, I could write my own python to take advantage of a model. But why reinvent the wheel? The support community here is also stellar.

4. AI Podcasts - Who has time to stay up to date on the newest AI techs? I tune in weekly to my favorite AI podcast: [This Day in AI](https://podcast.thisdayinai.com). I particularly like this podcast because of their sense of humor and their hands on experiments with the newest AI techs.
