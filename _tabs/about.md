title: "Navigating the AI Jungle with Lane Blundell"
---
Welcome to the Wild West of AI, where models are the cowboys, data is the gold, and GPUs are the trusty steeds. I'm Lane Blundell, your fearless collaborator in this new digital frontier. I'm here to share my adventures (and mishaps) as I wrangle unruly models, untangle code spaghetti, and chase down the elusive AI unicorn.

I believe the best way to learn is by doing, so buckle up and get ready for a bumpy ride! I welcome all feedback, no matter how harsh.

Join the posse! Follow me on my blog, LinkedIn, and email if you have any questions, suggestions, or just want to commiserate about the latest AI blunder. Cheers to the wild ride:
